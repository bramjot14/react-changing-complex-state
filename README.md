# React – Changing Complex State

This mini project was built as part of the **"Changing Complex State"** module in a React course.  
The goal of the project is to understand how to manage and update **complex state objects** using the `useState` hook while working with forms.

## 📌 What This Project Demonstrates

- Managing multiple related values using a single state object
- Updating state safely using the **functional form of `setState`**
- Understanding and using `prevValue` to avoid overwriting state
- Implementing **controlled form inputs**
- Dynamically updating UI based on user input

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- JSX

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- Why complex state should be updated immutably
- How `prevValue` ensures reliable state updates
- How React re-renders components on state change
