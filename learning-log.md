### React – Changing Complex State

Completed:
- Learned how to store multiple related values inside a single state object
- Understood why complex state updates require the functional form of `setState`
- Used `prevValue` to safely update individual properties without overwriting others
- Implemented controlled inputs using the `value` attribute
- Handled multiple form inputs using a single `onChange` handler
- Strengthened understanding of React re-rendering on state updates
- Built a complete mini project to reinforce complex state handling

Key Takeaway:  
When state depends on previous values, React requires functional updates to ensure reliability and prevent data loss.

## 🧠 Final Note (important)
This project is **exactly the kind interviewers expect** when asking:
Question: “How do you update nested or complex state in React?”
Answer: In React, nested or complex state is updated immutably using the functional form of setState.
I copy the previous state and update only the required fields to avoid overwriting existing data.
